# satRod
A project aiming to create a custom Joystick using an Arduino Leonardo.

Follow me on [Busy](https://busy.org/@targodan) or [Steemit](https://steemit.com/@targodan) if you want to see any tutorials for this project as soon as they are uploaded.

## Cloning this Repo

If you want to clone this repository, especially if you want to just use the files and not contribute, you should consider cloning only the latest change using this.

```bash
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/targodan/satRod.git
```

The reason for this being that the 3D files are rather big and this will greatly decrease the time it takes to clone this repository.

## Tutorials

Following me is in no way a requirement to see the tutorials. Here is a list of already released tutorials. More will follow.

- [Reading Buttons with a Microcontroller](https://d.tube/#!/v/targodan/lybimad3)
- [Overview of the included 3D Models](https://busy.org/@targodan/r9bloye6)

DTube is a fairly new platform with a few problems. Should the videos not be available try again at a later time. Should they still not be available then feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/targodan/satRod/issues/new). I will do my best to make the videos available.

## Files for 3D printing

If you want to print your own Elite Dangerous custom Joystick you need to print the following parts in the given number:

- 1x buttonsEnclosure
- 1x buttonsPanel
- 1x fssEnclosure
- 1x fssPanel
- 1x cableClamp
- 4x joystickMount
- 2x rotaryMount90degPartA
- 2x rotaryMount90degPartB
- 1x rotaryMountStraight

Everything can be printed without supports assuming you orient the parts correctly in your slicer.

Additionally you need some metric screws or close equivalents:

- 28x countersunk 2.9x9.5 screws
- 4x regular 2.9x9.5 screws (can also be countersunk)
